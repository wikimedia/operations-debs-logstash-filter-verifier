Description: Test framework for Logstash filter configuration files
 Lets you verify the correctness of your Logstash filters by running
 Logstash and feeding it log data defined in test case files that also
 contain the corresponding output events that you expect. If Logstash
 doesn't produce the expected events the test fails and the diff between
 the expected and actual events is shown.
